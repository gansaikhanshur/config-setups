This Repo Contains Configs for the following:

1. vimrc
2. zshrc

(Intended for personal use only as I prefer to keep them simple. For anything flashy, I recommend [this for vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) and [this for zshrc](https://travis.media/top-10-oh-my-zsh-plugins-for-productive-developers/))
